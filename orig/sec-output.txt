% Impactful papers in these areas include, for example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Cowley, \& Charles, (2016). Behavlets: a Method for Practical Player Modelling using Psychology-Based Player Traits and Domain Specific Features. 	User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 26(2), 257–306. $\rightarrow$ JUFO 3 venue
%   \item Cowley, {\it et al}, (2008). Toward an understanding of flow in video games. Computers in Entertainment, 6(2), 1–27. $\rightarrow$ >500 citations
%   \item Cowley, {\it et al}, (2016). The Psychophysiology Primer: a guide to methods and a broad review with a focus on human–computer interaction. Foundations and Trends in HCI, 9(3–4), 151–308. $\rightarrow$ field-leading handbook
% \end{itemize}
I have also produced publications for professional communities \href{https://bestprac.fi/2018/10/29/neurofeedback-training-of-adhd-patients-why-we-need-more-research/}{(Veilahti \& Cowley, 2018)}, as well as artistic works (e.g. design/production of GREEN MY PLACE serious game).
